Must Do's:
 - Add a blacklist option for hiding servers in the server browser.
 - Add more global player statistics
 --> Kits used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Weapon used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Vehicle used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Vehicle vs Weapon Pie Chart
 --> Wins by Army Pie Chart
 --> Expansion / Mod played pie chart
 --> Top played maps
 --> Average SPM

Nice To Have's:
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.
