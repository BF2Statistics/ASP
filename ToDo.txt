Must Do's:
 - Add a blacklist option for hiding servers in the server browser.

Nice To Have's:
 - Snapshot module face lift. Ability to view round details of a round (from a snapshot) before it
    is saved into the database (requiring manual admin authorization).
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.
 - Page /player/view/:id => Add next 3 ranks progress like Bf2sclone had
