Must Do's:
 - Remove delete player option (causes stats fragmentation)
 - Add player map data and top servers played in in the /players/view/ screen
 -

Nice To Have's:
 - Undo and subtract player stats on rounds where cheating is caught (Undo Snapshot)
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.

Thinking Abouts:
 - Ridding of processed snapshot files, and storing round specific data for each player in the database.
