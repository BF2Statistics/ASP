Must Do's:
 - Add a blacklist option for hiding servers in the server browser.

Nice To Have's:
 - Undo and subtract player stats on rounds where cheating is caught (Undo Snapshot)
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.

Server Identifying:
 - Prefix (ServerId On Host) -> AuthToken (Approved or declined with lists of IP Addresses)
