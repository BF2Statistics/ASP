Must Do's:
 - Remove delete player option (causes stats fragmentation)
 - Add player map data and top servers played in in the /players/view/ screen
 - Add a blacklist option for hiding servers in the server browser.
 - Add a Game Mod management system, only allowing games playing admin whitelisted game mods to be saved to the database.

Nice To Have's:
 - Undo and subtract player stats on rounds where cheating is caught (Undo Snapshot)
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.
